    a remote server entities can have their position interpolated via
    this component. The component, when coupled with an InterpolationSystem
    will travel towards the given target position using the given timestamp
    to linearly interpolate movement. This component is not limited to
    networked entities, and can be used anywhere linear interpolation of
    movement is desired.
